This was posted over reddit a few months ago, [Apparently Ad Blockers are not allowed on Youtube. Is this a new thing they've implemented?](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/13cfdbi/apparently_ad_blockers_are_not_allowed_on_youtube/?rdt=64832) and judging by all the recent comments and posts all over [r/youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/), this change was just rolled out on a **larger scale**.

This blocker is designed to monitor advertisements, automatically seek the ads and skip them. It's important to note that this doesn't classify as traditional ad blocking, as the ad content is technically "loaded".

Nevertheless, the extension's underlying logic enables it to fast-forward through the ad content to its conclusion. The entire process is optimized to occur within an extremely brief timeframe, typically **<=50 milliseconds**, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.


## Install

> **Note:** For those who want an easy one-click Chrome extension, for whatever reason, Google rejected the publication of the extension for bogus reasons. I have raised a complaint and trying to get it published as soon as I can.

This section explains on how to install the extension utilizing the _developer mode_,
