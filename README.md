This was posted over reddit a few months ago, [Apparently Ad Blockers are not allowed on Youtube. Is this a new thing they've implemented?](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/13cfdbi/apparently_ad_blockers_are_not_allowed_on_youtube/?rdt=64832) and judging by all the recent comments and posts all over [r/youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/), this change was just rolled out on a **larger scale**.

This blocker is designed to monitor advertisements, automatically seek the ads and skip them. It's important to note that this doesn't classify as traditional ad blocking, as the ad content is technically "loaded".

Nevertheless, the extension's underlying logic enables it to fast-forward through the ad content to its conclusion. The entire process is optimized to occur within an extremely brief timeframe, typically **<=50 milliseconds**, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.
